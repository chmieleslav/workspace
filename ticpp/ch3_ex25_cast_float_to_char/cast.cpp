/*
Define a float variable. Take its address, cast that address
to an unsigned char and assign it to an unsigned char
pointer. Using this pointer and [ ], index into the float
variable and use the  printBinary( ) function defined in
this chapter to print out a map of the float (go from 0 to 
sizeof(float)). Change the value of the float and see if
you can figure out whatâ€™s going on (the float contains
encoded data).
